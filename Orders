In this SQL, I'm quering a database with a couple of tables to 
quantify various statitics about customers orders and locations. 




1) Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, 
   and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT DISTINCT location,
                count(orderID) 
  FROM JanSales
 WHERE location LIKE "%New York%"
 GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) > 2
 ORDER BY count(orderID) DESC;



2) How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT DISTINCT product,
                SUM(Quantity) 
  FROM FebSales
 WHERE product LIKE "%headphone%"
 GROUP BY product;
 

3) What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hint: For this question, 
 we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account).

 SELECT SUM(Quantity * price) / count(acctnum) 
  FROM FebSales
       JOIN
       customers ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;


4) What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like 
   question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
   
 SELECT SUM(Quantity) / count(acctnum) 
  FROM FebSales
       JOIN
       customers ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;



5) Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product,
       SUM(Quantity * price) AS Revenue
  FROM JanSales
  GROUP BY Product
  ORDER BY Revenue desc
 LIMIT 1;
